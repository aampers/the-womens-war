  What would you do if the government collapsed? Over the last eight years, the
  men and women of North-East Syria have had a chance to answer that question
  for themselves. Using the political theories of an American anarchist and a
  Kurdish terrorist, they've built a feminist oasis in the middle of the world's
  most brutal war. Music: "Bella Ciao" by Astronautalis (feat. Subp Yao &
  Rickolus) Footnotes: Bella Ciao: A “Kurdish Anthem” Made in Italy, Has Become
  a Global Sensation The PKK: Coming Down from the Mountains (Rebels) Revolution
